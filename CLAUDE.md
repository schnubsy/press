Global rules: council arc instrument

# press — Claude instructions

## Purpose

press is the marquee **publishing target** for the council. It hosts single-file pages
served via GitHub Pages. `index.html` is the portal (KICKERS / ICONS driven by `pages.json`);
`pages.json` maps `filename → title`, `spaces.json` the tier split, `tenants.json` the tenant registry.

Served pages by tier (contract: `docs/spec.md` → Tenants):
- **Public:** `kayley.html`, `council-guide.html`, `eagle-path.html`, `halvsies.html`, `agent-health.html`
- **Private wing** (WebAuthn passkey + vault): `fsa.html`, `giving.html`, `retirement.html`, `card-scout.html`, `access.html` (family admin)
- **Family wing** (email OTP + JWT + per-page grants): `remit.html`, `perth.html`

## Stack & how to run

- **Host**: GitHub Pages at https://schnubsy.github.io/press/
- **No build step** — static HTML files only
- **Publish**: via the council press instrument (Lane A hash-verify → commit → push)
- `pages.json` must be updated whenever a new page is published
- `agent-health.html` connects to Supabase all-apps views at runtime (client-side JS)

## Current stage

Live; **arc/wings-polish COMPLETE (2026-09-24, #16 `17091f6`)** + **T7 follow-up (#17 `166f56b`).**
Private wing re-locks every **7 days, fixed from unlock**; mobile wing cards one word per line with "N tools";
perth title "The Runway — Perth"; Family Access = invite + per-person family-app switches (**opt-out grants**,
`press_access_has` live-verified); printable **private-wing recovery kit** (no email reset, by design).
tenants-check **T7 `tool-cfg`**: every personal data page must be in `TOOL_CFG` (Connect your tools + kit).
Gauntlet: node 69 · Playwright 56 · tenants-check 29/0. The 4 published tenant pages inline 8h until each
app's own next release (vendored gate already 7d). No press inbox pending.

## Project rules

- This is a **publishing target** — pages are authored elsewhere and published here by
  the council press instrument (or an app's own `tools/release.js`), not built in-repo
- Do NOT modify source pages (`*.html`), `pages.json`, or `.github` in this repo
  unless you are the press instrument completing a publish
- **`spaces.json` is repo-owned and OFF-LIMITS to release scripts.** Release scripts only
  READ it (the fail-closed personal-space gate); they must never write it. It decides the
  public/personal split and must never depend on `press_portal` (anon read/write).
- `db/*.sql` mirror the applied Supabase migrations; `src/vault.js` is inlined into
  `index.html` via `tools/inline-vault.mjs` (`--check` guards drift) — the site keeps no build step
- All control-file changes (CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md, ARC.md, docs/) are safe to edit
- Lane A publish: hash-verify content before commit; Lane B: any emergency hot-patch
  must be documented in docs/evidence/

## Where things live

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Portal — reads `pages.json` + `spaces.json`; inlines `src/vault.js` |
| `pages.json` | Page manifest — object keyed by filename `{title}` (release scripts write it) |
| `spaces.json` | Public/personal split `{v,personal[]}` — repo-owned, release scripts only READ it |
| `src/vault.js` · `test/` | Vault module (HKDF + AES-GCM + WebAuthn PRF) + Node/Playwright tests |
| `db/` | Applied Supabase migrations (`press_vault`, `press_deals` gate) |
| `docs/` | Spec, history, lessons, evidence |
| `docs/spec.md` | Portal + page contract |
| `docs/history.md` | Arc history (dated milestones) |
| `docs/lessons.md` | Tag conventions & press lessons |
| `docs/evidence/` | Screenshots, slice receipts |
| `ARC.md` | Arc inbox (pending items) |
| `HANDOFF.md` | Current state & next actions |
